    <h2>Her Journey</h2>
    <p>
        <b>INTRODUCTION</b>
    <p>
        Anandibai Gopalrao Joshi (31 March 1865 – 26 February 1887) was the first Indian female doctor of western medicine. She was the first woman from the erstwhile Bombay presidency of British India to study and graduate with a two-year degree in western medicine in the United States.[1] She was also referred to as Anandibai Joshi and Anandi Gopal Joshi (where Gopal came from Gopalrao, her husband's first name).[citation needed]
    </p>
        <b>EARLY LIFE</b>
    <p>
        Anandi bai Joshi was born Yamuna, in Kalyan, on 31 March 1865, the fifth of nine children.[2][3] She was raised in a Marathi Chitpavan Brahmin family[4][5] [page needed] As was the practice at that time and due to pressure from her mother, she was married at the age of nine to Gopal rao Joshi, a widower almost twenty years her senior.[6] After marriage, Yamuna's husband renamed her 'Anandi'.[7] Gopalrao Joshi worked as a postal clerk in Kalyan. Later, he was transferred to Alibag, and then, finally, to Kolhapoor (Kolhapur). He was a progressive thinker, and, unusually for that time, supported education for women. She was also a relative of Pandita Rama bai.[8]
        
        At the age of fourteen, Anandibai gave birth to a boy, but the child lived only for a total of ten days due to lack of medical care. This proved to be a turning point in Anandi's life and inspired her to become a physician.[9] After Gopalrao tried to enrol her in missionary schools and this did not work out, they moved to Calcutta. There she learned to read and speak Sanskrit and English.

        Her husband encouraged her to study medicine. In 1880 he sent a letter to Royal Wilder, a well-known American missionary, stating his wife's interest in inquiring about a suitable post in the US for herself.[10] Wilder published the correspondence in his Princeton's Missionary Review. Theodicia Carpenter, a resident of Roselle, New Jersey, happened to read it while waiting to see her dentist. Impressed by both Anandibai's desire to study medicine, and Gopalrao's support for his wife, she wrote to Anandibai. Carpenter and Anandibai developed a close friendship and came to refer to each other as "aunt" and "niece." Later, Carpenter would host Anandibai in Rochelle during Joshi's stay in the U.S.[11][6]
        
        Anandibai addressed the community at Serampore College Hall, explaining her decision to go to America and obtain a medical degree.[12] She discussed the persecution she and her husband had endured. She stressed the need for female doctors in India, emphasizing that Hindu women rather than men could be better to serve as physicians to Hindu women.[11]

        In the 1800s, it was very unusual for husbands to focus on their wives' education. Gopalrao was obsessed with the idea of Anandibai's education and wanted her to learn medicine and create her own identity in the world. But this obsession turned out to be abusive. One day, he came into the kitchen and found her cooking with her grandmother and proceeded to go into a raging fit. It was very uncommon for husbands to beat their wives for cooking instead of reading. As Gopalrao's obsession with Joshi's education grew, he sent her with Mrs Carpenter, a Philadelphian missionary, to America to study medicine. Before her voyage, she addressed a public hall in 1883. She addressed the lack of women doctors and said "I volunteer myself as one."[13]

        <b>IN THE UNITED STATES</b>
        <p>
        Anandibai Joshee graduated from Woman's Medical College of Pennsylvania (WMCP) in 1886. Seen here with Kei Okami (center) and Sabat Islambooly (right). All three completed their medical studies and each of them was among the first women from their respective countries to obtain a degree in Western medicine.
        Anandibai travelled to New York from Kolkata (Calcutta) by ship, chaperoned by two female English missionary acquaintances of the Thorborns. In New York, Theodicia Carpenter received her in June 1883. Anandibai wrote to the Woman's Medical College of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, asking to be admitted to their medical program,[14] which was the second women's medical program in the world. Rachel Bodley, the dean of the college, enrolled her.
        
        Anandibai began her medical training at age 19. In America, her health worsened because of the cold weather and unfamiliar diet. She contracted tuberculosis.[9] Nevertheless, she graduated with an MD in March 1886; the topic of her thesis was "Obstetrics among the Aryan Hindus." The thesis utilized references from both Ayurvedic texts and American medical textbooks.[11] On her graduation, Queen Victoria sent Anandibai a congratulatory message.[9][15]

        <b>RETURN TO INDIA</b>
    <p>
        In late 1886, Anandibai returned to India, receiving a grand welcome.[16] The princely state of Kolhapur appointed her as the physician-in-charge of the female ward of the local Albert Edward Hospital.[17]
     </p>
        <b>DEATH</b>
 <p>
         Anandibai died of tuberculosis early the next year on 26 February 1887 before turning 22 in Pune. Years preceding her death, she was fatigued and felt constant weaknesses. Medicine was sent to her from America but there were no results so she kept studying medicine until death. Her death was mourned throughout India. Her ashes were sent to Theodicia Carpenter, who placed them in her family cemetery at the Poughkeepsie Rural Cemetery in Poughkeepsie, New York. The inscription states that Anandi Joshi was a Hindu Brahmin girl, the first Indian woman to receive education abroad and to obtain a medical degree.[16]
